Pearson Regression
Constraints
The Developer must program all calculations without relying on a package.

User Stories
- User can see an input panel with two input fields allowing entry of x and y coordinates, and 'Add' and 'Calculate' buttons.
- User can enter numbers into these boxes where x and y are observations from the two data sets.
- User can click the 'Add' button to add the x and y to a tabular output area listing the pairs of observations.
- User can see and error message if either of the two input fields are empty or do not contain valid real numbers.
- User can see the 'Calculate' button is disabled until errors have been corrected.
- User can click the 'Calculate' button to perform the regression analysis and to display its results.
- User can see results of the calculation which include:
 - Arithmetic means for both the x and y observations
 - Standard deviations for both the x and y observations
 - Pearson correlation coefficient with one of the following interpretations:
  - No correlation
  - Neutral
  - Some correlation

Bonus features
- User can see a scatter plot of the observations
- User can upload observations from a file on the local machine.
- User can see a regression line overlaying the scatter plot
