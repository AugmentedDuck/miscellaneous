Requirements & Constraints
 For this app you'll want to use the NPM package QRCode Generator to encode the information you collect from the attendee in a QR code.
 To test your implementation you'll need to download a QR code reader onto your smartphone or tablet. There are many such readers that are free of charge. Check the app store for your device to find the one that best suites your needs.
